                    Skills are the specific abilities and competencies 
                    that enable individuals to perform tasks effectively.
                     They can be technical (related to software, tools, etc.)
                     , soft (interpersonal skills), transferable (applicable 
                     across roles), and job-specific (relevant to a particular
                      job or industry). It's important to showcase these skills 
                      on a resume or in interviews with examples to demonstrate 
                      proficiency and suitability for a role.</p>
